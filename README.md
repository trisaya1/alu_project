# 4-bit ALU in Verilog

## Overview

This project implements a **4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** in Verilog, designed and simulated using **Xilinx Vivado**.
It supports a set of arithmetic and logic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and bitwise logic.
This design includes carry and zero flags for status reporting, making it a reusable block for CPU datapaths.


This ALU is part of my hardware engineering portfolio for internship applications. It demonstrates not only Verilog design and simulation skills, but also **incremental feature development**, **structured verification**, and **Git-based project management**.
